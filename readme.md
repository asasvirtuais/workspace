Asas Virtuais in an Open Source initiative for Web Development

This repository is a pnpm workspace that allows developers to share local dependencies across multiple projects. Local dependencies are installed from the packages directory instead of being downloaded from the npm Registry.

PNPM is recommended here because, as of the time this was written, it is the best and fastest package manager for TypeScript.

TypeScript is required, to simplify the development process Asas Virtuais packages are not transpiled to JavaScript.

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is recommended for development to allow https on localhost with ease.
